# Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive report and documentation for the code provided, which focuses on image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNN) analysis. The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, PIL (Pillow), and Google Colab utilities. The main steps include loading an image from a URL, displaying and manipulating the image, and performing convolutional operations with randomly generated filters.

**Colab Notebook Link:** [Image_Processing_and_CNN_Analysis](<insert your Colab link here>)

## Section 1: Loading and Displaying the Image

The code begins by loading an RGB image from a specified URL using OpenCV. The image is then displayed using both Matplotlib and OpenCV in Colab.

```python
# Section 1: Load RGB image from URL using OpenCV
url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/PNG_transparency_demonstration_1.png"
response = requests.get(url)

try:
    img_array = np.asarray(bytearray(response.content), dtype="uint8")
    img = cv2.imdecode(img_array, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Section 2: Plot the loaded image
try:
    plt.imshow(img)
    plt.title("Original Image")
    plt.show()

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Section 2: Display the loaded image using OpenCV in Colab
try:
    from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
    cv2_imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Results:
- Original Image Displayed

## Section 4: Plotting a Line Along a Specific Row or Column

A line plot is generated by extracting RGB values along a specified row, and the luminance is calculated.

```python
# Section 4: Plot a line along a specific row or column
row_to_plot = 100  # Adjust the row number as needed

# Extract the RGB values along the specified row and calculate luminance
row_values = np.mean(img[row_to_plot, :], axis=1)

# Plot the line
plt.plot(row_values, label=f'Row {row_to_plot}')

plt.title("Line Plot of Image")
plt.xlabel("Column")
plt.ylabel("Pixel Value")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Results:
- Line plot of RGB values along a specified row

## Section 5: Image Array Shape

The shape of the resulting image array is printed.

```python
# Section 5: Show the shape of the resulting image array
img_array = np.array(img)
print("Original Image Shape:", img_array.shape)
```

### Results:
- Original Image Shape: (height, width, channels)

## Section 6: Crop, Pad, or Resize the Image

The code demonstrates cropping and resizing the image to 224x224x3.

```python
# Section 6: Crop, pad, or resize to 224x224x3
cropped_img = img_array[50:150, 50:150]  # Adjust the cropping coordinates as needed
resized_img = cv2.resize(cropped_img, (224, 224))

# Section 7: Plot the cropped image as a line plot
row_to_plot_cropped = 50  # Adjust the row number as needed for the cropped image
row_values_cropped = np.mean(cropped_img[row_to_plot_cropped, :], axis=1)

# Plot the line
plt.plot(row_values_cropped, label=f'Cropped Row {row_to_plot_cropped}')
plt.title("Line Plot of Cropped Image")
plt.xlabel("Column")
plt.ylabel("Pixel Value")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Results:
- Cropped and Resized Image Displayed
- Line plot of cropped image

## Section 8: Convert the Resized Image to Grayscale

The resized image is converted to grayscale.

```python
# Section 8: Convert the resized image to grayscale
gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(resized_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
```

### Results:
- Grayscale Image Displayed
- Line plot of grayscale image

## Section 11: Randomly Generate 10 n x n Filters

Ten random filters of size n x n are generated.

```python
# Section 11: Randomly generate 10 n x n filters
n = 3
filters = [np.random.randn(n, n) for _ in range(10)]
```

### Results:
- List of 10 randomly generated filters

## Section 12: Convolve the Image with Each Filter and Plot

The resized image is convolved with each filter, and the resulting feature maps are displayed alongside the corresponding filters.

```python
# Section 12: Convolve the resized image with each filter and plot the resulting images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(10, 4))

for i, (current_filter, ax) in enumerate(zip(filters, axes.flat)):
    # Convolve the image with the filter
    feature_map = cv2.filter2D(resized_img, -1, current_filter)

    # Plot the feature map
    ax.imshow(feature_map, cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title(f"Feature Map {i+1}")

    # Plot the filter
    ax = plt.subplot(2, 5, i+1)
    plt.imshow(current_filter, cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Filter {i+1}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results:
- Display of feature maps and corresponding filters

## Section 13: Plot Each Resulting Image (Feature Map) Alongside the Corresponding Filter

The code further visualizes each resulting image (feature map) alongside the corresponding filter.

```python
# Section 13: Plot each resulting image (feature map) alongside the corresponding filter
fig, axes = plt.subplots(10, 2, figsize=(8, 20))

for i, (current_filter, ax_row) in enumerate(zip(filters, axes)):
    # Convolve the image with the filter
    feature_map = cv2.filter2D(resized_img, -1, current_filter)

    # Plot the feature map
    ax_row[0].imshow(feature_map, cmap='gray')
    ax_row[0].set_title(f"Feature Map {i+1}")

    # Plot the filter
    ax_row[1].imshow(current_filter, cmap='gray')
    ax_row[1].set_title(f"Filter {i+1}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results:
- Display of feature maps and corresponding filters in a grid
